# __RigWizard__
## Introduction
**RigWizard is** a website inspired by steam which allows users to browse games and compare the game  requirements to their computer configuration: with this tool finding game compatible with one's computer becomes **simple** and less frustating
## Setup
This project was made by using **React with TypeScript** for the frontend **and php** for the backend.
The frontend setup is great since it allows to develop easily: react uses component, which make code more modular. **Paired with react we used TailwindCSS and daisyui**: tailwind allows the developers to ignore css entirely and daisyui offers free simple components based on tailwind.

## Configuration guide
Per configurare il progetto:
-clona la repository dentro a xamp/htdocs

-cd frontend
-npm install

per startare il server e quindi visualizzare il sito (tipo che quando salvi ti si aggiorna la pagina):
npm run dev
(per aprire nel browser metti localhost:5173)
