# __RigWizard__
## Introduction
**RigWizard is** a website inspired by steam which allows users to browse games and compare the game  requirements to their computer configuration: with this tool finding game compatible with one's computer becomes **simple** and less frustating
## Setup
This project was made by using **React with TypeScript** for the frontend **and php** for the backend.
The frontend setup is great since it allows to develop easily: react uses components, which makes code more modular. **Paired with react we used TailwindCSS and daisyui**: tailwind allows the developers to ignore css entirely and daisyui offers free simple components based on tailwind.

## Configuration guide
To start the project:
-Clone repository inside xamp/htdocs

inside frontend folder:
`-npm install`

to start react server and therefore see on-save changes:
`-npm run dev`
(localhost:5173 in browser)
