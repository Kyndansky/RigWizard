# __RigWizard__
## Introduction
<span style="color: #007bff;">**RigWizard**</span> a website inspired by steam which allows users to browse games and compare the game  requirements to their computer configuration: with this tool finding game compatible with one's computer becomes <span style="color: #007bff;">**RigWizard**</span> and less frustating
## Setup
This project was made by using <span style="color: #007bff;">**React with typescript for the frontend and php for the backend**</span>.
The frontend setup is great since it allows to develop easily: react uses components, which makes code more modular. <span style="color: #007bff;">**Paired with react we used TailwindCSS and daisyui**</span>: tailwind allows the developers to ignore css entirely and daisyui offers free simple components based on tailwind.

## Configuration guide
To start working on the project:
1. Clone repository inside xamp/htdocs
2. Move inside the frontend folder: `cd frontend`
3. run `-npm install` to install all dependencies
4. run `-npm run dev` to start react server and therefore see on-save changes (localhost:5173 in browser)
