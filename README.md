# __RigWizard__

## Introduction
**RigWizard** is a website inspired by steam which allows users to browse games and compare the game requirements to their computer configuration: with this tool finding game compatible with one's computer becomes **simple**
and less frustrating.

## Setup
[![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-20232A?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=61DAFB)](https://react.dev/)
[![PHP](https://img.shields.io/badge/PHP-777BB4?style=for-the-badge&logo=php&logoColor=white)](https://www.php.net/)
[![DaisyUI](https://img.shields.io/badge/daisyUI-5AD7E4?style=for-the-badge&logo=daisyui&logoColor=white)](https://daisyui.com/)

This project was made by using **React with TypeScript for the frontend and PHP for the backend**.

The frontend setup is great since it allows to develop easily: react uses components, which makes code more modular. 
**Paired with react we used TailwindCSS and daisyui**: tailwind allows the developers to ignore css entirely and daisyui offers free simple components based on tailwind.

## Configuration guide
To start working on the project:
1. Clone repository inside xamp/htdocs `git clone https://github.com/Kyndansky/RigWizard.git`
2. Move inside the frontend folder: `cd frontend`
3. run `npm install` to install all dependencies
4. run `npm run dev` to start react server and therefore see on-save changes (localhost:5173 in browser)
> [!NOTE]  
> Don't forget to start MySQL and Apache servers on xampp. without this requests to the backend will not work
